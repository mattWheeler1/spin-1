# Turbulence in spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates

## 1. Introduction
Topological defects are ubiquitous across many physical systems. Spinor Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) give rise to a rich collection of vortex configurations otherwise unseen in scalar BECs. This PhD project aims to probe the structure and dynamics of such vortices within different spinor systems.

## 2. Features
This project has
- Methods for generating different initial state configurations for generating quantum turbulence.
- Methods for generating different dipole configurations for testing basic
dynamics of different vortex types.
- Fully functioning and efficient vortex detection algorithms based on a plaquette detection method.

To add:
- [ ] Object-oriented approach to the current vortex detection algorithm, improving speed and overall cleaner syntax.
- [ ] Add new ways of generating initial turbulent states.
